# Dependencies

I've already pushed the package.json and package-lock.json files in 'src/frontend/'. You can simply run the following command on terminal(in correct dir) to install dependencies:

- npm install

- yarn install

To test server, run the command on terminal:

- npm start

# Requirements

Always install 'requirements.txt' using command:

- pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run server

In 'src/backend/', run the command to check if server is active:

- python3 manage.py runserver
